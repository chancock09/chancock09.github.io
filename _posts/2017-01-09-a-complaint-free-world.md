_Notes from Will Bowen's [A Complaint Free World](https://www.amazon.com/Complaint-Free-World-Complaining-Enjoying/dp/0770436390)._

A complaint is an energetic statement that focuses on the problem at hand rather than at the solution.

If you’re like most people, you complain daily — often — to get attention, remove responsibility, inspire envy, gain power, and excuse poor performance. Remember, criticisms are complaints disguised as direct attacks, and sarcasm is passive-aggressive complaining. Translate both into equivalent complaints then, tackle them head on.

The most type of complaint is a simple cry for attention attention. Cultivate more positive interactions by asking, “What’s going well right now?”

Sometimes complaints are attempts to validate victimhood and justify lack of effort. Ask: “If it was possible, how would could it be done?” Make the answer actionable: try laying out the path to success in a perfect world. Then, compromise if you must.

Bragging and gossiping to inspire envy are complaints as well. We point out flaws in others to reassure ourselves we have the opposite traits. Instead think about how you can be more secure with that trait.
Rather than deploying complaints to gain power over others, address your problems directly by speaking with the person. Be constructive and work out your differences. Difficult conversations are often a route to improvement for all involved.

When complaints attempt to justify poor results after the fact. Respond to excuses by asking, “What do you plan to do differently next time?”

Ultimately, rather than rationalizing failures, treat them as learning opportunities. Focus on the future, plan to prevent the problem next time. Readily share your flaws and failures with others. Practice [radical candor](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/). Don’t play the [victim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle).

You’ve never complained anyone into positive change. Not even yourself.
