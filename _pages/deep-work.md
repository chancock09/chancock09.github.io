> [The task of the craftsman is] not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there. — [Dreyfus & Kelly](href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/141659616X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=141659616X&linkCode=as2&tag=chancock-20&linkId=091363694970a1a613f13240724c6323)

#### Happiness

Happiness is generally framed in terms of *circumstances*. In reality, *what we
pay attention to* is more important. Diligently focus on positivity, connection,
and growth and you will be happier.

Structure promotes focus which in turn promotes happiness.

which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate, and to
lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires
much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. — [Mihaly

Structure your downtime to have built-in goals, feedback, and challenges as
well. Plan it in advance. If you haven’t planned anything, be comfortable with
boredom and don’t turn to simple distractions.

#### The Skill of Attention


According to [Talent Code](http://thetalentcode.com/), deliberate and
concentrated practice promotes myelination around the firing neurons. Focus is
essential for isolating important pathways. Constant task switching causes
neural patterns to be firing all over the place, breaking this important
process.

A successful knowledge worker:

1.  Quickly masters hard things
1.  Produces at an elite level in terms of quality and speed

Ask yourself this question:

> How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate to
> do this task?

The longer the better. Focus on those tasks. They’re pushing your limits.

#### Process, Process, Process

Diligence is key. Focus on creating and ritualizing a process that works for
you. Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants.

Train by scheduling breaks *from focus* rather than *from distraction*. Plan
times with you *will not be thinking deeply* into your day knowing that
*thinking deeply* is the default.

#### Plan

Structure execution in your daily life:

1.  Focus on the wildly important
1.  Act on lead measures
1.  Keep a compelling scorecard
1.  Create a cadence of accountability

What’s the **lead measure** for knowledge work? Time spent in **flow states**.
How can you optimize?

#### Think

Use *productive meditation*. Train your brain to better structure thought:

1.  Collect *relevant variables*
1.  Answer a *next step* question
1.  *Consolidate* gains by reviewing
1.  *Repeat* to completion

#### Shut Down

It might help to have a shutdown ritual to convince your brain loose ends are
tied up. Do something like:

1.  empty inbox
1.  review task backlog
1.  write down top 5 tasks for tomorrow
1.  leave and don’t think about them again until you read your list in the morning

#### Use the right tools

Design your life. Every routine you have, website you use, friend you hang out
with, and activity you participate should promote your happiness. Treat them as
tools.

Make concrete goals. For each tool, ask yourself: does it have *substantially
positive impact*, *substantially negative impact*, or *no impact* on achieving
my life’s goals?

Avoid “Any Benefit” thinking. Eliminate any tool that isn’t having
*substantially positive impact* for something wildly important to you.
